description: A planet once considered lost for ten millineia, Kyrthe, has re-emerged with a new moon, Kryptin. The moon has had some unknown effects on the planet. According to our databases, we can detect several areas with so-called "paranormal" activity. We have branched a part of our AI to a new blue faction named "Byte" to research it on their own.
