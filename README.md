# Lunar-Abyss
A planet once considered lost for ten millenia, Kyrthe, has re-emerged with a new moon, Kryptin. The moon has had some unknown effects on the planet. According to our databases, we can detect several areas with so-called "paranormal" activity. We have branched a part of our AI to a new *blue* faction named "Byte" to research it on their own.

Kyrthe is a simple planet, made of yellow and pink rock, with an atmosphere made out of small rock particles so thick, that it's impossible to see. Luckily, we used our great technology known as CFCs to destroy 80% of the atmosphere so you can see. I know, you can thank us later!
